Infernal is a single-player <span className="red-bold">horror</span> survival VR game. You are boarding a train filled with zombies and _special zombies_, and you have to survive using ordinary items available all over the cabin.

> Also, the train is on 🔥, so extinguish some fire while you're at it. Hope you can multitask well.
