Are you afraid of the dark? 🕯️

Embark on this 2D puzzle-platformer adventure game. You play as an unnamed child labourer in a mine shaft, stranded and alone after a collapse. Navigate the dimly-lit flooded mine with the singular goal of escape, swimming between air pockets to get through the labyrinth of tunnels. What lies within the tunnels? If you found out, you wont survive.

> For a maximum experience, play this in a dark room equipped with a great sound system.
