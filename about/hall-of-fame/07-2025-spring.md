Aperture is a first-person horror game that immerses the player in an abandoned hospital where survival depends on stealth, strategy and resource management. The core mechanic is exploration & survival, as it revolves around the player having to find photographic evidence of any paranormal activity while avoiding an unseen yet highly perceptive entity.

The player’s only means of detecting the entity is through a limited-battery video camera, introducing a risk-reward dynamic where resource conservation and spatial awareness are crucial.

Blood Thirsty is a management-action game where players step into the shoes of a discerning vampire connoisseur, obsessed with curating the finest human delicacies. Each
night, the vampire prowls the dark, neon-lit streets of a gothic city, harvesting blood and organs from unsuspecting humans. These ingredients are then transformed into luxurious blood-based concoctions at his exclusive underground cafe, serving a clientele that demands sophistication.

The goal is clear: to gather every type of organ and craft the ultimate menu, pushing the boundaries of vampire gastronomy.

Dimension Deuce (DD) is a top-down dungeon-crawling roguelite where timing is everything. As a rising tennis star thrust into a dimension where tennis is outlawed by the
oppressive Evil Tennis Inc., you must fight through twisted courts guarded by Roger Federont’s minions. The game focuses on deflection-based gameplay—you can shoot, but
the true path to victory lies in skillfully returning enemy shots with your racket.

With power-ups, fast-paced combat, and a lineup of delightfully terrifying bosses, Dimension Deuce oﬀers a unique twist on the dungeon-crawler genre.

In Sushi Shakedown, you play as a former gambler striving for redemption by running a small sushi stall in a vibrant, anime-styled rural Japanese town. However, your new life comes with a heavy burden: a crushing daily debt owed to the local Yakuza. Each
