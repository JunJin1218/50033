# ü•á Lab 3

üéâüçæ Here we commemorate the efforts of students who have made our labs fun and interesting. Thank you for your hard work and contribution.

### Action Mario

At this point, we're not sure what the genre of the game is anymore. Who cares? As long as it's fun. Also, seems like we have multiple-time winner ü•≥!

### SmartGoombas

What if the Goombas can chase you? How cute, holding little flashlights.
