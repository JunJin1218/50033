# 2023

SuperMarioBros and guns? Why not.

### PurpleLaserMario

When you're too skilled to just use basic Unity Physics Engine + Animation + Particle System: write your own **shader**. Giving Mario a laser gun to decimate Goombas is brilliant.

## ü•á Lab 2

### Portal (but not really)

What if Mario just uses Portals to travel instead of just... _walking_ and _jumping_?

### GoryMario

Well, things can take really unexpected turn there. Also, seems like we have multiple-time winner ü•≥!

## ü•á Lab 3

### Smash Mario Bros

What's more fun than smashing a couple of poor Goombas with a Hammer?

### Action Mario

At this point, we're not sure what the genre of the game is anymore. Who cares? As long as it's fun. Also, seems like we have multiple-time winner ü•≥!

### SmartGoombas

What if the Goombas can chase you? How cute, holding little flashlights.

## ü•á Lab 4

### Guns N' Spiders

Uh, so we aren't even trying to make a variant of Super Mario Bros anymore at this point.

### Flying Mario

Mario is not just a plumber, but he's also a bird. He is a living proof that one can dream high and fly.

### Shooting In Space

üí•üí•ü§Øüí£ in space is supposed to be silent, right? Since there's no air or other matter to transmit sound waves and what not, but that's ok. Fun games are more important.

> Also, there's an NSFW portion locked as "hidden level" in the game. We have respectfully removed it to save everyone from feeling like bleaching their eyes afterwards ü•π.

## ü•á Lab 5

### Celeste?

We are way past SuperMarioBros at this point. Doesn't matter, this is really pretty.

### Horror Mario

We have seen this before, but now it's just so much more complex (and scary, or funny, you decide).

More is more, that's the motto.
