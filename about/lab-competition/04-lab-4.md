# 🥇 Lab 4

🎉🍾 Here we commemorate the efforts of students who have made our labs fun and interesting. Thank you for your hard work and contribution.

### Guns N' Spiders

Uh, so we aren't even trying to make a variant of Super Mario Bros anymore at this point.

### Flying Mario

Mario is not just a plumber, but he's also a bird. He is a living proof that one can dream high and fly.

### Shooting In Space

💥💥🤯💣 in space is supposed to be silent, right? Since there's no air or other matter to transmit sound waves and what not, but that's ok. Fun games are more important.

> Also, there's an NSFW portion locked as "hidden level" in the game. We have respectfully removed it to save everyone from feeling like bleaching their eyes afterwards 🥹.
